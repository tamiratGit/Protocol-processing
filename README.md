# Protocol-processing
Hello group.

I've took libery, and have made GitHub repository for course project.
I am not sure, how this works in Windows, but if you to start, you should create directory for project.
Install github(this i dont know how to in Win)
Navigate to project directory, and do _git clone https://github.com/sginne/Protocol-processing.git_

After this is done, you will get README.md, and possibly some other files from repository, which are of the moment not there yet.

Feel free to play around, if you want to commit changes you've made to local files, you've got to add file
git add README.md
git add dummy.txt

or just git add *

You can check status of repository - _git status_

Ok, now all necessary files added, but changes still reflected only localy.

To make changes appear in repository, you've got to

git commit -m "First commit"

Here you go, have fun, please add something(like name) to dummy.txt
